# Flask-Blog Web Application
## Activate virtual environment on windows using the following command example:
```python
C:\Users\'Username'\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
### Overview
The project entails:
* Getting started with creating a Flask app
* Templating with Jinja
* Using Forms and validation checks
* Creating a Database using  Flask-SQLAlchemy
* Restructuring the application into a package rather than running from a single module. This has major benefits in terms of importing modules across the application
* Adding users to the Database
* Creating an authentication system so that users can log in and log out of our application by using flask-bcrypt and flask-login extensions
* Enabling profile picture upload on user account
* Adding the ability for users to create, update, and delete posts. Also preventing users from updating posts that don't belong to them.
* And finally enabling Pagination. Pagination allows one to only load a select number of items at a time basically allowing partitions. Links to different pages are displayed at the bottom of the page so users can quickly navigate to the page of their choice. 

*Created by following guided steps from a tutorial by Corey M. Schafer*
